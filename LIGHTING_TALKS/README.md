# ⚡️ Lighting Talks

## Description

Lighting Talks are one of the most entertaining and inspiring sections of IPFS Events. These serve to enable everyone attending the conference to share an update on their own projects with the whole community. Lighting Talks are designed for high throughput, high velocity, and large coverage.

## Instructions

## Overview

- **Objective**: Allow many projects to disseminate information across the entire set of attendees.
- **Activity**: In a lecture format, allow a group of people to give pre-prepared 5-minute updates on their projects.
- **Outcome**: Recordings of all the project updates and shared context for conference attendees to operate from.

## How

Short presentations (5 minutes) in rapid succession. Folks send their slides ahead of time (for fast swap) 

Participants will have the chance to propose Lighting Talks in advance through Github or through a Google Doc.
