# ðŸ§© Unconf

## Description

We will host an Unconf segment during IPFS Camp to create space for all the conversations, talks, discussions and idea sharing that didnâ€™t get the opportunity to be discussed during the other sessions.

## Instructions

## Overview

- **Objective**: Create a space to host all sorts of discussions to be had in person that didnâ€™t fit all the other sessions
- **Activity**: Each participant gets to propose sessions or attend sessions from others.
- **Outcome**: The results from the unconf sessions should be uploaded to the IPFS Camp repo by the session attendees.

## How

Unconf sessions will be proposed on the event itself. There will be a wide board with available slots in which folks can propose and vote for the sessions.
