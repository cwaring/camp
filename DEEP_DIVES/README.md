# üêã Deep Dives

## Description

The Deep Dives format is designed to give all participants a taste of what it feels like to work on the big and meaty Open Problems by contributing directly to them in an intense design session - evaluating all the possible solutions, their advantages and shortcomings, and documenting the results.

This type of discussion is core to the genesis of IPFS. We‚Äôve done multiple over the years which have yielded many valuable results such as IPLD, PubSub, GraphSync and other advancements to the original IPFS protocol.

These design sessions are not about explaining how things work, they were focused on finding the solution with the knowledge and resources we had available.

## Instructions

### Overview

- **Objective**: Deep knowledge transfer that only happens in synchronous interactions.
- **Activity**: In a group of max 4 people, dive deep on a complex technical design topic.
- **Outcome**: The output of each of these sessions would be a RFC like document (can be very raw) that describes the proposed solution (even if with known shortcomings), or it could be a map of all the important concepts, obstacles, and related topics you covered in the session.

### How

- **Duration**: 1:45h
